        Our Story starts from across the pond. Owners Helen and Tim have lived 
        in the States for quite some time now, but once called a village named 
        Dedham home.  Over the years many things have changed except their craving 
        for authentic fresh fish and chips.  With the opening of Scrumptious Fish & Chips, 
        the Korinth's have set out to introduce the original European fish & chip to the 
        California food scene.
        <br>
        <br>
        At Scrumptious, we dive into the heart of European culinary tradition 
        while embracing the soul of California food culture.  Think of our fish 
        & chips as a deliciously mindful fusion between European gastronomy and 
        the West Coast’s renowned farm-to-table fare.  Authenticity matters to 
        us.  So does the journey in which your ingredients travel in order to 
        land on your plate!
